“When one learns to read, one learns a peculiar way of behaving of which physical immobility is only one feature. Self restraint is a challenge not only to the body but to the mind as well. Sentences paragraphs and pages unfold slowly, in sequence and according to a logic that is far from intuitive...  the literate person must learn to be reflective and analytical, patient and assertive always poised, after due consideration to say no to a text."
